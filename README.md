Hello, I am Sandra Kumah, a passionate data enthusiast experienced in transforming raw data into meaningful sight and
unraveling complex data to explore the vast landscapes of machine learning.
My interest is in;

- Python programming and data analysis (libraries: imblearn,sklearn,pandas,Numpy)
- Machine learning algorithms ( Regression, classification)
- Data visualization (libraries: seaborn, Matplotlib)
  
  I’m currently learning clustering and deep learning. I have a strong belief in the power of collaboration, hence let's connect, innovate, and build a data-driven future together.
